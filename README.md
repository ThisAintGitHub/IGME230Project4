# IGME230Project4
This repository will hold the final project of this class. My [class website](https://people.rit.edu/yik4306/igme230/) will be holding it once it has been finished.

## Proposal:

I plan for the website in this project to display the three graphics in which each page is a tribute representing the three big console companies. If time permits, I may even try and add an extra page for PC games.

First, I must have a landing page where the user can access any of the three graphics at their discretion. I will likely try and go with Materialize because I am more used to the navigation made by that template. I will likely use icons in a format similar to that of Exercises 6 and 7.

For the graphics pages, what I will do is make each page first display the latest console of their respective companies, and then, upon that image being clicked, create a parallax effect while transitioning from each console into a world of items from their most iconic games, each having their own effect when hovered over. For example, a page involving the Nintendo Switch will have the Switch's remotes slide out and shoot up into a white space, displaying things like a Pokeball - which might have its upper half lift up, and Mario's cap - which could possibly have a coin shoot up and fall back down from behind. For the time being, the plan is to slide the controller away from the console and make the browser "follow" the controller as it slides towards the iconic game items.
